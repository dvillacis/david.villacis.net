title: "First Order Methods for High Resolution Image Denoising"
author: "David Villacis"

abstract: "In this paper we are interested in comparing the performance of some of the most relevant first order non-smooth optimization methods applied to the Rudin, Osher and Fatemi (ROF) Image Denoising Model and a Primal-Dual Chambolle-Pock Image Denoising Model. Because of the properties of the resulting numerical schemes it is possible to handle these computations pixelwise, allowing implementations based on parallel paradigms which are helpful in the context of high resolution imaging."
