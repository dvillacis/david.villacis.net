title: "Solving Bilevel Optimization Problems in Image Processing via Inexact Trust Region Methods"
conference: "Workshop on Analysis and Applications of Stochastic Systems (IMPA)"
date: 2016-04-14
city: "Rio de Janeiro"
country: "Brazil"
description: "In this work weâ€™ll look at the numerical solution of the problem of parameter learning in Total Variation (TV) image denoising models. The parameter learning will be based on training samples used within a PDE optimization problem. We will propose an Inexact Trust Region Algorithm and compare its performance with other numerical methods such as Semi-smooth Newton and Quasi-Newton Methods."
