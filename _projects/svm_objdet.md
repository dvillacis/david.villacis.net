description: "Object detection is considered to be one of the most challenging computer vision tasks, it consists in finding instances of generic objects in images and video. The object detection process consist of three basic components: object search, feature extraction and classification algorithm. One of the most popular classification techniques for the object detection task is Support Vector Machine (SVM). Even though this classifier can make use of kernel functions to discriminate data more accurately, most of the existing applications make use of linear kernels. We argue that the use of different kernels will improve the performance of this kind of systems. In this work the average performance of an object detection system using a SVM classifier trained using different kernels was compared against the PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) benchmark. Findings indicate that the use of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel can improve the average precision of an object detector system up to 15% according to the object to be detected"
