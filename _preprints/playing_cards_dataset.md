abstract: "This is a photographic dataset collected for testing image processing algorithms. The idea is to have images that can exploit the properties of total variation, therefore a set of playing cards was distributed on the scene. The dataset is made available at http://www.fips.fi/photographic_dataset.php and a MATLAB friendly .mat file can be downloaded <a href='https://storage.googleapis.com/pagina-personal.appspot.com/img_research/img_datasets/playing_cards_dataset_reduced.mat'>here</a>"
